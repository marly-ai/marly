- 🔍 Extract data based on multiple schemas from numerous documents without a vector database or specifying page numbers
- 🔄 Built-in caching to enable instant retrieval of previously extracted schemas, allowing for rapid repeat extractions without reprocessing the original documents.

## 🧰 What is a Schema?

A schema is a set of key-value pairs describing what needs to be extracted from a particular document (JSON format).

    "Exposure (FMV + Unfunded)": "The exposure including fair market value and unfunded commitments in millions of dollars",
    "% of Total Exposure": "The percentage of total exposure",
