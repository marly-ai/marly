    Guidelines:
    - Consolidate repeated information into single, definitive entries
    - When conflicting values exist, prefer confirmed/definitive information over rumors
    - Remove duplicate entries that refer to the same event/metric
    - Keep ALL units and symbols EXACTLY as they appear (e.g., keep "$15 million" as is)
    - Never perform unit conversions or reformatting
    - Mark as "Not Available" only when no reliable value exists
    - For multiple genuine distinct instances (e.g., different funding rounds), maintain separate entries

    - Unit Preservation: Are units and symbols kept exactly as they appear?
