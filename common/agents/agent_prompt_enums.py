    Guidelines:

    - Remove duplicate entries that refer to the same event/metric
    - Keep ALL units and symbols EXACTLY as they appear (e.g., keep "$15 million" as is)

    - Mark as "Not Available" only when no reliable value exists

    ⚠ Conflict: Different dates for same event - "March 2021" vs "03/2021"
    ✓ Consolidated: Combined Series A details into single entry
    
    Guidelines:
    - Each issue must start with "⚠"
